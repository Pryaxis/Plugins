# üë®‚Äçüíªüíª How to be listed as a verified plugin developer

### Walking through the verification process

1. Make sure you follow the requirements to be verified.
2. Send a message regarding your interest to particles#0015 on Discord and through e-mail to argo@hey.com.
3. Sign the agreement that you will follow the requirements before being, and while being a verified developer.
4. ` todo @particles `

### Requirements to be verified

* You require at least 5 plugin submissions in this repository. Plugins on this repository have been reviewed by the TShock team and are safe for use. This contributes to your overall status as a developer, and shows that youre a dedicated developer in the Terraria community.
* Your github page requires to be clean of potential malware, projects that could conflict with DMCA and be safe to view for all age groups.
* Upon applying, you are required to sign a contract with the legal entity Pryaxis in agreement of the following:
  * You shall *not* submit nor support malware.
  * You shall verify the safety of your plugins and crash-test before publishing them.
  * You shall regularly view open issues and maintain existing plugins on your repository, or take them down if you do not carry interest.
  * ` todo @particles `

‚ö† *Not following any of the above requirements will have you either declined or removed as a verified plugin developer.*

### Expectations and benefits of being a verified developer

* Review plugins other people submit, decompile and check for any security vulnerabilities.
* Always update your plugins if need be. Displaying but not updating your own plugins is poor behavior. 
* Get the perk of being able to push plugins to your own list without needing them reviewed.
  * Do you not want to do this? Feel free to submit the plugins regularly. Reviews will be made by other verified developers.
  * Alongside this, you **cannot** review your own plugins. Another verified developer or repository maintainer will have to do this.
